Some of this is out of date in this version but here are the notes that came with the original 2000 version.

! Phototalk for Hugo
! Ported by Robb Sherwin
! Original source by Adam Cadre
! Release 1.0
! March 25th, 2000
! This is a Hugo port of the Inform menu-based conversation system originally used in the 1998 release "Photopia." 
!
! The original Inform Phototalk source can be found here:
!     ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/programming/inform6/library/contributions/phototalk.inf
!
! David Glasser's object-oriented Inform Phtalkoo.h port can be found here:
!     ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/programming/inform6/library/contributions/phtalkoo.h
!
! I currently know of two Inform games that use these routines for conversation. They are here:
!
! ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/games/zcode/photopia.z5
! ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/games/zcode/chix.z5
!
! Q: Why use Phototalk as opposed to normal ASK ABOUT and TELL ABOUT routines?
! A: Phototalk helps a game with a well-defined player character to show off some of those
!    character traits a little easier. The author is able to allow the player to choose
!    from a series of different conversation quips and the player doesn't have to worry about
!    guessing the correct phrasing for the (usually) single-word subject matter. 
!
!    Additionally, as an author, you will have all the game's conversations in one section of
!    your game's code. Phototalk does not stop you from implementing ASK ABOUT and TELL ABOUT
!    routines, so you could, of course, use both. 
!
! Q: Will this .HUG file compile?
! A: This should compile under Hugo 2.5 and 3.0 without modification. 
!
! Q: What specifically do I need to throw into the Hugo source code of my own program?
! A: You need the "phototalk" verb defined. You may want to replace the standard "TALK" verb with
!    phototalk, of course. You need to set up the quip array declarations. The global variable "selected"
!    need to be defined. And everything after "routine Phototalk" in this source code needs to be
!    added to your code as well. 
!
!    The routine "ResetQuips" is what inititally sets up characters with their immediately-available
!    conversations. You will want to put a call to that routine in your "init" routine. 
!
! Q: Are there any Hugo games that currently use the Phototalk routines?
! A: At the time of this writing, no. I am planning on entering a very short Hugo game into 
!    the upcoming Dragon-Comp, and when I do so I will make the source to that game available. 
!    More, I fully intend to send the source code for any upcoming Hugo games to GMD to help
!    support Phototalk for Hugo with more examples. 
!
! Q: I have a found a bug or have a question about this code. Who should I contact?
! A: Please contact Robb Sherwin at robb_sherwin@juno.com regarding questions or comments with this
!    Hugo port. I would be happy to help you get this code working correctly in your game. 
!
! Q: Which version of Hugo was this developed on?
! A: It was developed on version 3.0.
