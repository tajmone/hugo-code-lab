IMPORTANT- This is not a library replacement. It is an update. In
some cases, routines have been replaced to resolve bugs. In some
cases, they have been replaced with "jump"-less versions just so 
they are more replaceable (in case one needs to replace them). In
other cases, they have been replaced for slightly different
functionality, and several new routines and verbs have been added.

Include "roodylib.g" BEFORE "verblib.g", and include "roodylib.h"
AFTER "hugolib.h" for best results.

Why "roodylib"? It is not meant to be an egotistical thing (in fact,
many of the components of roodylib.h have been written by other
people). It is mainly just a silly way to denote that this is a
temporary addition; I imagine there will be an official library
update somewhere down the line that'll make much of this
unnecessary. In the meantime, enjoy!
