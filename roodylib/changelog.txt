Ok, I've started a changelog!
v 2.9 - * Added Object Sorting section to complement ListChildren routine
	* Fixed CalculateHolding bug
	* Fixed DoUnlock/DoLock. some messages weren't called correctly and now it makes sure that
	keys are available (and not in a closed box or something).
	* Added ability to string manipulation to write the results to a second array (instead
	of overwriting the original array)
	* Added optional NO_LOOK_TURNS flag to quickly allow games where DoLookAround, DoLook,
	DoLookIn, and DoLookThrough do not take a turn.
	* Added some object-picking code to extraroutines.hug to make it easier to pick 
	objects/elements from parents or arrays based on routine-based criteria
v 2.8 - * Made characters default to having exclude_from_all true
        * Added a ClearArray call to FindStatusHeight to prevent room from being printed twice
          in statustype-less games
        * Updated rdyshell to call flags.hug, switchgram.g, and inclusions.h
	* new "New Style Pronouns" and "Routine Grammar Helper" sections added
v 2.7 - * Added ROODYBANNER and ROODYVERSION constants to make it easier for games to proclaim
	the Roodylib version in DoVersion and/or the game title segment, if they choose.
	* Added default "XYZZY" response so Hugo authors aren't bugged to provide responses.
	* Use the NO_XYZZY flag if you'd like to turn it off.
	* Added USE_EXTENSION_CREDITING section for listing included extensions in CREDITS responses
	* Added a status_top property to the printstatuslib system so status windows can coexist
	with graphical windows in multimedia games (status_top should equal the top row number of
	the status window)
	* Added asterisks to section headings to make it easier for my text editor (EditPlus) to jump
	to sections (so now I can set my Function List search to look for lines that begin with "!*")
	* Updated PropertyList, ListObjects, and PrintArrayList (the last is in extraroutines.hug)
	to add optional "conjunction" argument, so object listing can be a means of providing
        choices. Created ListChildren routine which sets the list_count global so ListObjects works
	correctly in such cases.
v 2.6 - Modified DoUndo so it resets verbroutine to &DoUndo after successful UNDO
	( a successful UNDO changes the verbroutine to the routine that was successfully
	UNDOne, but that leaves the door open to after and react_after properties being run
	again)
	changed "test" local variable in RedrawScreen to something less generic
	updated CenterTitle to work with strings bigger than screen width
	tweaked some door code,
	Updated PrintScore to give the top ranking in games even when score surpasses MAX_SCORE (so
	ranking still works in games with broken scoring or games with extra easter egg points)
v 2.5 - Added NO_AUTOMATIC_DOOR_UNLOCK flag for disabling door-auto-unlocking (that is,
	doors that your player automatically unlocks if you go in their direction with the
	proper key)
	Fixed status-window-clearing code in DoUndo
v 2.4 - Cosmetic release. Organized roodylib, grouping similar routines.
	Moved uncommonly-used routines to "extraroutines.h" file.
	#set USE_STRING_MANIPULATION to use string manipulation routines
	#set USE_AFTER_UNDO if you want after_undo array capabilities
	(others- NO_SORTING, USE_ROLLABLES)
v 2.3 - Improved ProcessKey routine, added "checkheld_holder" object,
        fixed DoGo problem ("A bit redundant, don't you think?" wasn't getting
        called)
	Created ClearWordArray routine
	Added ClearWordArray calls to DoUndo and DoRestore
	Found a huge Hugo bug where multi-line xverb definitions only understand
	the first line as xverb. Now roodylib pre-declares the xverbs and splits them
	all into one line definitions.
	Changed the DoEnter grammar definition so it made use of some unused code in DoEnter
	Tweaked DoEnter

V. 2.2 - Added an improved door class and RlibOMessage, a Roodylib object message routine
         Made DoListen and DoSmell give non-helpful responses to objects

pre V. 2.1- Who can remember?
