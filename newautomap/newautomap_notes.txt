NewAutomap-
This version can be used with glk interpreters. If you'd like to change
the characters used in the map, replace the map_chars object:

object map_chars
{
	u_to "u"
	d_to "d"
	in_to "i"
	out_to "o"
	room_char
		{
		if system(61) ! glk in this instance
			return "\#164"
		else
			return " "
		}
	player_char
		{
		if system(61) ! glk in this instance
			return "O"
		else
			return "*"
		}
}

If used with "window.h", setting the map_window global to a window object
will send a map to that window each turn.

Old notes (automap v2)-

This is a tweaked version of Cardinal Teulbach's automap.h contribution. Very little is changed, so be sure to read the original docs.
Added was a couple "locate"'s to return the cursor to the original part of the screen after drawing a map. Also, the AUTOMAP ("map on") command
now draws a window so the map doesn't slide off the screen after a slew of xverbs or unsuccessful commands.

Also, personally, if I were to use the full map command, I'd probably include a pause and clear the screen afterwards or something. Anyhow, play around with automap2.h and maptest.hug. I don't think any one game is expected to use every part of it, so go ahead and just take what you like!
